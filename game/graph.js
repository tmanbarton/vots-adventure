There you see what might be the shimmering of a lake in the mountain sun. There's also a foot path going northwest.";
const dynamiteHolesDescription = "There are a bunch of holes drilled in the wall here. The miners of old must have thought about using dynamite to blow up this part but changed their minds. The rails split again. The railway now leads down, north, and up a slope to the sw.";

const lightningTreeDescription = "You're in a little clearing with a large tree in the middle that looks like it was struck by lightning a long time ago. The bark has long since fallen off and the remaining part of the tree is a reddish color.";
const mineEntranceDescription = "You've come to the entrance to this abandoned gold mine. The supports on it are looking a little worn and there are some loose nails that might come in handy if you could safely get them out of the rotten wood. You could enter to the east if you're very careful. Piles of tailings are all over with one path away from the entrance to the north.";
const mineShaftDescription = "This is the mine shaft. It looks like it could cave in at any moment. There's a small wooden sign here that says \"BEWARE OF TOMMYKNOCKERS\" with an ugly picture of one the green-skinned, dwarf-sized creatures. The mine shaft continues east.";

const outsideTavernDescription = "On the east side of the road is a tavern with a wooden sign hanging above the door with \"Tommyknocker Tavern\" etched into it. Here is the former heartbeat of the town, now a dump of a place. Its roof has caved in and the walls look as if they could collapse at any moment. The road goes north from here.";
const picnicTableDescription = "A sturdy looking picnic table is in this little clearing you've stepped into and farther north a shed peeks through the trees. A tidy trail leads south.";
const privatePropertyDescription = "All around you is a dense pine forest that gives the air a friendly smell. There are a couple \"Private Property! Keep Off!\" signs nailed to trees, but no gates or anything so the owners aren't too concerned about dealing with trespassers. A driveway continues north and a tidy trail leads off into the forest to the northeast.";

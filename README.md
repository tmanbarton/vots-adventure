# vots-adventure
A text adventure for the web with influence from Colossal Cave Adventure and Zork called Vots.
Currently, everything is on the front end but I intend to someday have a backend that allows for a mutiplayer game.
I got the name Vots from where I based the first part of the adventure off of. The first few locations are based around a familiar plot of land in the mountains with a road named Vots (abbreviation for Valley of the Sun) nearby.
